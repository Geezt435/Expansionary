ingredients:
  list:
    - Tofu
    - Taco seasoning
    - Romaine
    - Tortillas
    - Mexican cheese blend
    - Spanish style rice
    - Roma tomatoes
    - Sweet onion
    - Cilantro
    - Lime juice
  qty:
    - 1 slab (pressed)
    - some
    - 2 hearts
    - "8"
    - some
    - 1 bag
    - "4"
    - 1&frasl;4 cup
    - 1&frasl;2 bunch
    - some
    - some

instructions:
  - Dice the tofu into ~ 1&frasl;2 cm cubes; fry dry until crispy, adding taco seasoning at the end.
  - "Prepare pico: chop tomatoes, onion, and cilantro, add lime juice and salt."
  - Cook rice according to its instructions.
  - Chop lettuce.
  - Wrap everything together.

notes:
  - I specify romaine in the ingredients list for measurement purposes, but pick your favorite leafy green.
  - I recommend storing leftover tofu and rice together, pico in another container, then cheese, leafy greens, and tortillas separately.
  - All ingredients can be acquired at Trader Joe's. The rice in particular is a good Joe's purchase.
  - I like to add a bit of spicy honey to the pico.
