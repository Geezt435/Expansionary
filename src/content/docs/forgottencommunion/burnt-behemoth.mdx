### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Origin?">

Although it is not known where this spirit came from, due to its weapon and its wrathful nature, it is possible that it was once someone who died in fire or was burned alive.

Its branding seal does have ornate designs, which could indicate that it was once a blacksmith or a craftsman of some sort. But why horned? Could be a reference that he's also a rancher, or a hunter of some sort. Or maybe it was just a random spirit that got angry and burned everything in its path.
