### Details

Rancher of the **Wraithwyrm**, a ghastly parasitic worm born on a dreamless nightmare, feeding on souls by ripping its prey's vitality as well.

It's also a vile and sadistic creature, who enjoys toying with its prey before it devours them, just like its harvester. It is considered a taboo to befriend such a creature, but it is not impossible.

It is also considered to be delicacy in some demonic cultures, as it is said to be able to grant its host a glimpse of dream seeking, a rare ability to see into the dreams of others, and even manipulate them.
