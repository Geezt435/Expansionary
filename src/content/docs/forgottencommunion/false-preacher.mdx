### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Past version?">

Originally called **Prayeth** it is always intended to be a de-buff unit, but it was too weak to be viable. It was later reworked into a functioning support that doesn't de-buff itself and allies too greatly.

Fun fact as well, it was originally supposed to be the original design of the **Unnamed Peasant**, albeit, slightly different in design and appearance.
