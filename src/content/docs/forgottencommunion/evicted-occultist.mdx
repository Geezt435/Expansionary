### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="False God?">

A taboo forbidden even amongst the occultist, the *False God* is lies and deceit, a false promise of power and glory. It is said that it manifest as an upside down humanoid with a single eye, and transcends to lure the weak-minded into its grasp, possessing them with its eldritch power.

It is said anyone who commune to it already lost themselves, and it is best to not know about it at all. Its true identity is unknown and not recorded, possibly a figment of imagination, or a true entity that exists in the deepest of the void.

<Accordion client:load title="Role in battle?">

Do not be mistaken, although his health is not as big as his cost, he is powerful punisher. He counters tank units on longer battles due to rust and can deal with melee units with his ranged whip.

His chain sword whip, not only excels in offense, but also defense. Combine it with rust he can take down strong enemy with relative ease.

One of the most effective ways to counter him is to overwhelm him with units that can do attack on medium to far range, since on close range his whip is very deadly.

He can also be countered by units that can inflict de-buff, or fast units that can dodge his attack.
