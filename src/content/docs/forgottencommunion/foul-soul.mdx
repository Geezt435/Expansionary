### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="What is it?">

Originally a civilian abducted by the cult, he was used as a sacrifice for a ritual that went wrong.

It was over in a blink of an eye, all the cultists in the nearest vicinity were consumed yet not a single evidence of the ritual was left. The only thing that remained was this abomination, a foul soul, a mistake that should never have been made.
