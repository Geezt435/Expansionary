### Details

Victim to involuntary fate so grim and suppressing, formless and forgotten. You could almost listen to its underwhelming voices. A dark human-like power is manipulated by this nameless wobbler. Devoid of soul, its invalid entity confliction causing a breach of reality, tearing apart into nothingness, drawing everything unto him.

Yet from its dark rift and dreadful looks, you feel a sense of lament.

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Unnamed Peasant Tomb?">

If you seen the similarity with the tomb of **Dark Peasant**, its because this unit was intended to be my version of **Dark Peasant**, not as a replacement but as a different version of it, but less wobbly and more unknown.

And funny enough, he used to act as the paper in the paper-rock-scissors game against **Dark Peasant** and **Super Peasant**. **Super Peasant** beats **Dark Peasant**, **Dark Peasant** beats **Unnamed Peasant**, and **Unnamed Peasant** beats **Super Peasant**. Its a very weird triangle of balance, but it works.

But now in the latest version, it is no longer the case, as **Unnamed Peasant** also kills **Dark Peasant** and **Super Peasant**. It is now a very weird triangle of imbalance, but no one uses him for balance anyway.

<Accordion client:load title="Background">

Despite being a peasant, it carried an unbound yet unfortunate tragedy. The world is cruel towards the weak, and peasants are no exception.

It embodies the essence of a forgotten soul, a being that has lost its purpose and identity to time and space. Records? Forgotten. Purpose? Forgotten. Existence? Forgotten. Even its own identity is lost, leaving no trace of who they were in history.

Even in death it only leaves a dead corpse of an unknown peasant, swarmed with flies and lifeless.

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="True Death?">

Practically not an effect, but pure instant death that ignores even revival effects. It is unescapable and absolute.
