### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="What is it truly?">

The giant body of flesh made of many human parts, all stitched together in a grotesque manner. With heads filled with eyes weeping with blood, and broken halo adorning the top of its head.

It is very grotesque and irregular design for unit but it is fitting for boss unit of **Forgotten Communion**. This thing is such an abomination that knowledge of its existence are highly cognito-hazardous, and it is best to not know about it at all.

But for any that has seen it, they will never forget the sight of it, the scream are familiar, the pain is real, and the suffering is related in both physical and mental state. It is a true embodiment of human tragedy, a patron in blood and suffering in flesh...

<Accordion client:load title="Changed versions?">

If you played the far FAR older version of Expansionary, you might remember the old version of this unit, which was not the abomination it is right now, but rather a giant human with a giant sword.

It was a very different design, and it was not as grotesque as the current version, but it was still a powerful unit. The old version was more of a traditional boss unit, with a giant sword and a more humanoid appearance, but it was boring and not as interesting as the current version.

I remember the day I revamped the unit, it was a long and tedious process, but it was worth it in the end.
