### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Nature Mithril?">

Unlike the usual Mithril found as ores of the mountains, this mithril is found in the forest. It is a special mithril that is enchanted by the forest itself. Protected by the waterfalls and the canyon, unlike normal Mithril, this material isn't as hard as the normal ones, but it has high natural magic properties.

<Accordion client:load title="Which media interpretation of elves?">

None actually, but at first it was supposed to be a reference to the elves in the **Middle Ring** or something, but I changed it to reference simply elves in general. This is to avoid some specifics details of outside elves. But, if it to be part of the **Fantasy** world then it would be one of those forest elves that are more in touch with nature and the forest.
