### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Why named Vulcan Imperator?">

**Vulcan Imperator** was inspired by the boss fight from **Minecraft**'s server called **Venture Land**, where at minimal **2** player are required for tryhard, while minimal **6** player are required for normal player even with maxed tier items. It was a fun and challenging fight, one that I have fond memories of beating with my guildmates. The fight was a bit buggy, but it was still a great experience. Man I miss those days. I hope you enjoy this unit as much as I did.
