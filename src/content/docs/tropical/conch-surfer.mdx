### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Surf Changes?">

Originally simply a **Surfer**, which was a ranged unit with broken damage, it was later revamped into the now mobility *AoE* unit. The **Conch Surfer** is now a weaponless close-ranged unit that can dash, making it more versatile in movement and less annoyance.
