### Details

Where wildness and justice are split by a single line, the **Dead Line**. Shows the true anarchy and morality of mankind.

The law falls on all as the borderline is its only rule. Dare to cross it, whether you're the most notorious criminal or well-known sheriff, you'll get punishment either from the *Good* or the *Bad*.
