### Details

A great flow of primal energy and winds flush through the air, a sense of instinctual fear and terror looms like a sense of helpless prey.

**It**, is no mere man, nor a mindless beast, but rather. A figure of an elderly divine entity, an ancient being formed from beyond perception, yet its as natural alike disaster.

And like a disaster, it has no reason for destruction. It is not evil nor good. It is the original cause of the immense ruination that plagues this great kingdom, *the great divide and demise*.

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Why is he the final boss instead of Soulforged Sovereign?">

The Ancestral Conquerer is the true final boss of the Primeval Kingdom, as it represents the original cause of the kingdom's downfall. The Soulforged Sovereign, while powerful, is more of a guardian of the ruins and a remnant of the past era. The Conquerer embodies the primal forces that led to the destruction, making it a fitting climax to the story of the Primeval Kingdom.

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="He is significantly differently themed from the rest of the Primeval Kingdom faction, why?">

It's not simply to make him different, it is because he is the antithesis of all ancient factions of kingdoms, the first to second last units are all remnants of the past, but the Ancestral Conquerer is a primal entity which must be avoided at all cost as much as possible, it is the original cause of many disasters and ruinations that plagued the lands and even other kingdoms, it is the original cause of the *great divide and demise*.
