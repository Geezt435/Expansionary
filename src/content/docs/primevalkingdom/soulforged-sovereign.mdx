### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Soulforged Sovereign previous versions?">

The Soulforged Sovereign was combinations of my previous units, **Soulforge Swordcaster** and **Elder Lord**, ranged and melee unit respectively. I decided to combine them into one unit, since it is more fitting to have a single unit that represents the final king of the ancient kingdom, rather than having two separate units that are not as cohesive.
