### Details

On a quiet abandoned castle and dusted wide room, lies an empty throne, several stone statues are seen standing still. But when you approach, they suddenly come to life, plunging their lance, keeping guard of the cursed throne.

Although subtle, you can feel their suffocation with their curse to imitate statues.
