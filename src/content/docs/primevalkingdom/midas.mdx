### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="How do you defeat him?">

He is not invincible, but he is immortal. Do not get too close to him, as his touch is fatal. Instead, use ranged attacks to defeat him.

<Accordion client:load title="I remember him stronger though?">

Yes, he was a lot stronger before the patch, with ability to change the terrain into gold, even weapon touching him would turn its wielder into gold as well. But he was nerved to balance the game, and now he is much weaker than before.
