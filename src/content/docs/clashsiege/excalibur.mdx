### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Why not named Arthur?">

Yes, it is a reference to the legendary sword of King Arthur, *Excalibur*. However, the name *Arthur* is not used simply to avoid the need for real historical accuracy. The name *Excalibur* is used to represent the legendary sword itself, which is a symbol of power and strength in many cultures.

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="Why is he the boss unit of the Clash Siege?">

If you noticed, *Excalibur* goes in the class of offense, relying on damage, speed and mobility. Its role usually rewards aggressive playstyle, which is the opposite of the *Guardian*'s defensive role.

Like the old saying goes, "the best defense is a good offense", and *Excalibur* embodies that saying perfectly. The more enemy against him, the deadlier he becomes.

Beside, damage dealer swordman is my favorite class in any game, and a knight with a legendary sword is just too cool to pass up :P
