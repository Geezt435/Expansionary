<Tab name="Main Attack">

#### Torch

A torch that can be swung to deal damage, but also used to light up dark areas. It can also ignite enemies, dealing burn damage over time.

#### Targeting Scroll

A scroll that when casted, deals no damage, but marked the targeted enemy, turning all teammates **Attack Priority** towards the pin-pointed enemy for **10** seconds, but some still walks toward their original target so, use this for ranged army or team that depends on attack target. Better use it wisely as well, as it is one-time use only.
