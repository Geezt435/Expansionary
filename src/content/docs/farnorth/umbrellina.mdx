### Details

A nimble, cold, and frigid duelist, excels in agility and antiquity. She was one of the unsuccessful royal princesses contending for the throne coronation amongst her many sisters.

Her ambition was yet to reign as queen, but all fall as she faced nothing but abandonment in the collapse of **Nod'jelunth**.

Fortunately, under the guidance of a *Lich* king after the fall of the fortress, she was taken under his wing into one of his disciples and transformed into a perilous assassin, carrying out its undisclosed decrees.

### Capabilities

<Tabs client:load>

<Tab name="Main Attack">

#### Cored Umbra Sabre

An ornate and elegant sabre that is capable of dealing heavy damage to enemies, deals piercing damage. Each swing sends her into a spinning flourish, conjuring ice shards that orbit her briefly before flying outward. Enemies struck are momentarily frozen, caught in the elegance of her fatal **Frostdance**.

The history holds no trace of its true lineage, yet its cold and crude craftsmanship suggests connections to an old **Winterland** forger.

#### Vantablack Umbrella

Once a frilly grey parasol of courtly afternoons, now pitch black, darker than shadow that is mainly used to dashes around due to its very low cooldown. In a way it could also be used to block projectiles when it is opened.

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Nod'jelunth?">

A dark and ancient fortress that had many royal princesses vying for the throne. It was a harsh society that bred ambition and ruthlessness. Many of them were orphans from sieges of wars, varied in age and background, but all shared a common goal: to become the queen of Nod'jelunth.

Why so? It was said the unsuccessful contenders would be abandoned and left to fend for themselves, some even not surviving the harsh conditions of the **Far North**.

**Umbrellina** was one of many failed to be the queen, and like many others, she was left behind when the fortress collapsed. However, her story did not end in her death. Instead, she was taken in by a mysterious figure known as the **Lich King**, who saw potential in her and transformed her into a deadly assassin.

Still to this day, she doesn't want to speak who the true queen of **Nod'jelunth** is, as if she's never accepted it, and she doesn't want to be reminded of her past as a princess.

<Accordion client:load title="Is she human?">

Although her ethereal look and cold demeanor may suggest otherwise, Umbrellina is indeed a human. Her commune with the **Lich King** and her transformation into an assassin have given her an otherworldly appearance, but she retains her human essence.

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="Assassin?">

Umbrellina's transformation into an assassin was not just a physical change but also a mental one. Under the tutelage of the **Lich King**, she learned the art of stealth, deception, and lethal precision.

Her past as a royal princess has given her a unique perspective on power and ambition, she won't use it against weaker foes, but rather to eliminate those who threaten her or her allies.
