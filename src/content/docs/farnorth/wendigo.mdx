### Details

A feral undead cryptic, hungry for fresh taste of flesh. It gnaws, claws, and scraps with insane tenacity! It's even capable of camouflaging into thin air and reappearing.

Although it's dangerously aggressive, its fragility weakens it extremely to any heavy attacks. And its body always leaves a trail of foggy chills, making it track to those sharp enough to notice.

If below **50%**, *Wendigo* retreats to his original place while healing. This ability is always followed by a trail of fog.

#### Uncanny Feeling

When target has been the prey for more than **10** seconds, target will be confused and weakened, becoming more vulnerable to attacks.
