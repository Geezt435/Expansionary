### Details

Where the edges of the world dissolve into the infinite chill expanse. Snow-capped peaks and crystalline structures dominated the vast horizon, enveloping what seemed like half of the known world, possibly even more.

On the furthest reach of the outskirts against the freezing winter, mythos reveal a land where **Brutes, Monsters, Titans, and Demigods** reside, a place far north of the known world, where the sun barely shines and the night is brutal.

The cold is piercing, the snow is blinding, and the wind is howling. This winter wasteland is a harsh and unforgiving place, where only the strongest can survive. So unforgiving that no map can accurately depict the harsh coarse land, and no one can predict the ever-changing weather.
