### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Who is she truly?">

Her ecstatic and gleeful demeanor hides a more peaceful and benevolent personality. The queen always loved to simply walks around the kingdom and the lands. Although her royal status is unquestionable, she is not one to flaunt her power or authority over others. Instead, she prefers to engage in friendly duels with her subjects, often challenging them to test their skills and abilities. Even viewed as a motherly figure by some.

She is along the species of **Ice Wraith**, a frost organism known for their affinity with all things cold. In duel, she often taunts her opponents, not because she is arrogant, but because she wants them to exceed her expectations. After all, it is for the sake of her kingdom, and she wants to see her people grow stronger. This makes her never holds back in a duel, and she will always give her all to ensure that her opponents are pushed to their limits.

Her ability to manipulate time doesn't come from her species, but rather her mastery over the mythical weapon **Moon Flower**. It requires a dedicated and arduous training to master the weapon, and she has spent centuries honing her skills, which she has time to do so.

<Accordion client:load title="Moon Flower?">

The **Far North** geography is only recorded by those of high nobility, and its center are aligned with the position of the moon. Mountains, hills, and valleys are all arranged in a way that they form a giant flower shape, even the rivers, storms and lakes are arranged in a way that they form the petals of the flower. It is unnoticeable from the ground, but from the sky, it is a sight to behold.

Thus, its possible that the **Moon Flower** rapier is a weapon that was forged by the ancients, possibly even before the **Time Queen** was coroneted. Its ornate design yet very smooth craftsmanship suggest it was formed not by a single forger, but rather a collaboration of many skilled artisans. And its blade is made of ice frozen in time, making it unbreakable and able to cut through time and space itself.

Rumors among the elders weave tales that she, perchance, holds the key to the genesis of her formidable blade, unlocking its true potential, a weapon of unrivaled antiquity, which should've only exist in mythos. During her training, she remarks the weapon's make her felt more... eased, it was giving her a sense of calmness, as if the cold sooths her mind. It was possible that many more weapons like this exist, but she felt satisfied enough with her own.
