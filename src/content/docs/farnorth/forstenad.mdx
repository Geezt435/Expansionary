### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Forstenad?">

The name "Forstenad" is derived from the Swedish word "f√∂rstenad," which means "petrified" or "turned to stone.". This mostly connects it to the petrifying effect of his attacks, which can stun enemies and leave them vulnerable to further attacks.

<Accordion client:load title="Is he even beatable?">

He fits the role of **Area Controller** unit despite looking like a **Tank** unit, his health is low so he could also be considered as a **Glass Cannon** unit. He is not unbeatable, but he is a great defender, and can be very dangerous if your army is aggressive and rushes into him without a plan.

Even though it is a slow unit, it is a very heavy punisher. It excels in melee combat, and if not careful can sweep the entire enemy army while keeping its position. Even more dangerous on **1v1** battles, not due to damage output, but due to its **Thunderbeat Stun** effect, which can stun chain its targets, leaving little chance for them to retaliate.

The best approach is to used ranged units, not light ranged projectiles, but heavy projectiles with AoE that can deal pierce through its shield, such as *Catapult*. Or even melee with distanced weapons, such as *Spear* or *Halberd*. Shielded units can also be used to block its attacks, but not as reliable due to his **Thunderstruck** ability, which can hit multiple targets at once despite the shield.
