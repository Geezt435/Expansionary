<Accordion client:load title="Connection to Bloodfaith Inquisitor">

Both uses dark magic, except one appears publicly rather than hiding it. When it comes to fighting, the Inquisitor have the upper hand, but this Witch assist in strategy and magic.

Though something for certain they share a mutual business relationship, one is for bloodlust and the other is for knowledge. They share their own code of honor and moral, but still held their own authority.

They are bound not by blood, but by a darker threadâ€”mutual survival, mutual secrecy. A witch hiding behind innocence, an inquisitor basking in carnage. The world would gladly see both burned, but together, they endure.
