#### Snapped Sword

A snapped standard metal sword, a broken blade that is still sharp enough to cut through flesh and bone. Although its range is effectively decreased, its attack speed is increased.

The **Rogue** used it as a dagger rather than a sword. Mastered with the art of stealth, they can sneak up on their target's back, replacing themselves with dusts.

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Design change?">

Not much changes, but their design is changed from looking like grim hooded shadowy figure to more human-like figure, it just makes it more believable that they are actually human, and not non-human entities.

Also the blade being changed from a big butcher knife to a broken sword, which is more fitting for a rogue class, and also more fitting for a rogue who is not a professional assassin, but rather a rogue who is more of a thief or a bandit.
