### Details

To care for another more than oneself, these sorrowful preachers heal by exchanging their own residue of life essence to their friendlies.

It is possible for them to recharge their own health if they focused on not just healing, but that's not possible unless someone's changed their target.

#### Health Cocoon

Ability to behave as a cocoon of health, constantly healing target teammates by transferring health to them in exchange for their own health but doubles the amount of heal.

If the target is enemy however, they will be harmed and **Dead Mourner** will be healed instead.

Upon their death, they explode into burst of medium heal for close allies.
