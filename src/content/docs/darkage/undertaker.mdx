### Details

Enters and leaves with no invitation, brooding, tall, and enigmatic. This old chap doesn't talk, but his presence is enough to signal that he's not here for a friendly chat.

Scythe on his hands, head adorned with a top hat, dressed in dark uniform suited for coffin makers. A giant coffin follows him, its contents unknown, carried by unseen forces, and it smells like your last breath.

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Soul Reaper?">

Grim Reaper in disguise, the Undertaker embodies the essence of death and despair. His connection to the afterlife grants him unique powers over souls, making him a formidable foe on the battlefield.

<Accordion client:load title="References?">

One of the most obvious references is to "The Backwater Gospel", animated short film by Bo **Mathorne**. The Undertaker's design and demeanor closely resemble the character from the film, with his tall, brooding figure, top hat, and scythe.

And although not a direct reference, and unknown power set wise, I deliberately planned his balance his power to connect with souls. Funny enough, his old design and name, "Soul Collector", was summary of his theme.
