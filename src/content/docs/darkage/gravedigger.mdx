### Details

Keeper of cemetery, warden of the graveyard, and the one who digs the tombs for the dead. But this is not just a job, this is a duty, for he also keeps his own secrets to the grave.

This mysterious man was an unruly descendant of elder vampires, young and morbid, yet for some reason acts like normal human, and not feral. Always seen in the graveyard, he finds solace in silence of the dead.

He keeps the graveyard clean, both from the disturbance of the living, and the undead.

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Revamp?">

Yes he was revamped many times, from old vampire, necromancer, to simply a gravedigger.

Designed to be more mysterious, his cloth and design fits more of a blind gentleman vampire hiding in the graveyard, rather than a necromancer who raises the dead or leader of the undead.
