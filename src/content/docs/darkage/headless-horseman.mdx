### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="If his head is floating, why would he still called headless?">

Looking closely at his head, its completely pulverized, spewing dark and foul liquid that resembles blood. The head is no longer a head, but a mere shell of its former vanity. Befitting for this tragic figure, as it represents the loss of his humanity and the despair he carries.

<Accordion client:load title="Terror Radius?">

You maybe heard of the term "Terror Radius" before, and if you guess it is a reference to the "Terror Radius" from Dead by Daylight, you are correct. Just want to clarify that this is not a direct copy of the "Terror Radius" from Dead by Daylight, but rather a homage to it.
