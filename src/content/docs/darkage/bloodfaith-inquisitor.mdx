### Details

> **CHAPTER I — THE BLOODLETTING FRUSTRATION LETTER.** <br></br><br></br> I WALK CLOTHED IN HAEMATAULICS, MY HAND A FIST OF TAINTED SCRIPTURE; I READ THE LEDGERS OF SIN IN FRESH WOUNDS AND FIND THEM THICK WITH LIES. MY SWORD IS THY SERMON, MY MASK THINE PENITENTIAL LEDGER — I DO NOT WASH; I DO NOT PARDON; I SET DOWN ACCOUNT WITH ICY DEVOTION AND BLADE'S JUDGMENT. THOU ZEALOTS WHO PRANCE FOR PRAISE, THOU INQUISITORS WHO SLUMBER IN HALLOWED HALLS — YE ARE SOFT-HANDED, HUNGRY FOR ACCLAIM, AND UNWORTHY OF THE SACRIFICE OF BLOOD. I SPIT UPON THY LITANIES; I SCOFF AT THY CANDLES; WHILE YE COUNT WORTHINESS IN WHISPERS, I LAY DOWN HAEMIC JURISPRUDENCE — COLD, PRECISIONED, UNYIELDING. HEAR ME, O READER: WHOSOEVER SINS OR HIDETH BEHIND SONG AND SCENTED FLAME, THUS SHALL I MARCH TOWARD THY DOOM — A PACE WITHOUT MERCY, SWIFT, INTRACTABLE, INEXORABLE. LET IT BE WRITTEN; LET IT BURN IN THE MIND; LET IT BE FEARED.

~ Bloodfaith Testament 1:1

### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Backstory?">

Terrifying yet its mask that resembles a crying man is a symbol of his past, a reminder of the atrocities he committed during his madness. Under its sad vanity, hides a man clinging on a last strand of his sanity.

His scars and wounds are hinted towards self inflicted injuries, a sign of his deranged state of torment and his disciple of pain.

His reason for inquisition is a mystery, but it might be his facade to hide his true intentions to hide the violence urges he has, and his need to punish those who he deems unworthy.

<Accordion client:load title="Connection to Brewer Witch?">

The Inquisitor and The Witch both have hidden business relation, and while both have each other distrustful, their trade of materials and discreet information is indeed important.

One of his most seeked out material is a potion to drown out the voices and anger, it soothes him and prepares him for confrontation more easily.

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="Blutfresser?">

It was a reference to a weapon from **Across the Time 2**, A minecraft map by **Piccomaster**. In short, it's greatest asset is its ability to leech health from enemies, making it a formidable weapon in close combat, especially for a tanky character.

Since it was the one of the main weapon I used during playing the map, I decided to name the main weapon after it. A decrepit yet complex weapon that fits the theme of the character. In its lore it was written by the Inquisitor himself:

> **CHAPTER XI — THE DEVIL'S DEMISE** <br></br><br></br> THOU FORGED THING, HEWN OF FORGE AND FURROW, I RAISE MY VOICE AGAINST THY ABYSSAL BREED; THOU ART A SERPENT OF STEEL, A CATHEDRAL OF RAZORS THAT MOCKS THE SUN — SMITE, AND LET THE EARTH GROAN. CAST DOWN, O HELL, FOR THIS BLADE IS JUDGMENT: IT TAKES BLOOD AS TRIBUTE, TURNS SIN TO FUEL, AND FEEDS ON THY OWN LIES. LET THE FLAMES THAT ANSWER THEE BE ASH BEFORE ITS HUNGER — FOR IT SIPS THE LIFE OF FOES AND TURNS THEIR WOE TO VICTORY. WRETCHED SHALL BE THE HAND THAT HOLDS IT, FOR IT IS A PULPIT OF PUNISHMENT, A SERMON WRITTEN IN WOUNDS. WHOEVER DARES DENY ITS STARE SHALL BECOME A TESTAMENT — NAILS OF FLESH, STATUES OF REGRET, OFFERINGS TO RUIN. BY THIS IRON DOCTRINE, THEY ARE CURSED — BOUND BY MEMORATION OF THE CRIMSON'S RESTRICTIVE LAW, THEIR NAMES REPUDIATED BEFORE DAWN. HEED NO PEACE; THE BLADE KNOWS NO MERCY: IT IS THE CHAIN THAT DRAWS DOWN HELL TO TASTE ITS OWN BILE. THY MACHINE SO CRUEL IN ITS REPRESSIVE TEARS, THUS HELL CRIES FOR MERCY.

~ Bloodfaith Testament 4:11

What it means in its actually? Possibly mad ramblings of a deranged mind, but it tells a bit about the weapon itself. It feeds on blood, and it punishes those who dare to oppose it. A weapon of judgment, a tool of retribution, and a symbol of the Inquisitor's punishment.
