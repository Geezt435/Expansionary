### Trivia

<Accordion client:load title="Further backstory?">

#### Valtiel

> It's appearance? Brutal and torn, an amalgamation with putrid fusions of flesh and metal. Its true nature? Unknown, but its angelic wings are still intact, even if they are tattered and stained with blood. It can be seen sometimes weeping or depressed, a total contrast to its violent look, even a polar opposite of **Pete S.D** behavior.

> Not much is known about this entity, but it could change its form if it wishes to, it just decided to take the form of a mutilated soldier, a form that is both familiar and unsettling to many. This could hint to the reasons it follows **Pete S.D.** alongside, why it stayed in battlefield with him. No one knows for certain, even **Pete S.D.** himself.

#### Pete S.D.

> It was debated whether he was a human. But, he is indeed a human, albeit a very, very odd one, which could explain his strange movement. Clothes always stained with blood and skins covered in dust, as if he had just come from a battlefield, only to return to it again.

> His limb and body feels wrong. He looks tired, yet his stare, they are empty with apathy, as if he has seen too much violence and lost in its grasp. It was like he was forced to witness it all, and held captive by something.

> **Pete S.D.** is unknown where or when he was born, its not even known if he had an actual origin. No official records of his birth or living, only some witness claims that recalls fighting alongside him, but never proofed in a single photograph or video.

> But scary enough, there is a proof that he was possibly real and alive, as there are cryptic imagery of cave paintings found in various places, depicting a human with a strange hands, and an angelic soldier-like figure standing above him, weeping. It was terrifying, yet fascinating, considering the time period of these paintings, they were made long before the dawn of modern civilization.

Other than all this, less is know of **Pete S.D.** and **Valtiel**. They are both mysterious figures, but their presence is very real for those fighting on battlefield.

<Accordion client:load title="Why war themed?">

Not necessarily themed in war, but it's about unnecessary violence. It is a pretty heavy topic, but such an interesting concept to explore, especially in **TABS** setting where such things are often glorified or romanticized.

Fortunately, this is just a game, and we can explore such themes without any real-world consequences, at least for now ðŸ˜….

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="Wait... Dawnedson?">

If you heard the name, **"Dawnedson"**, it is indeed reference to the **Dawnedson** family, the same bloodline of **Johnny Dawnedson**.

One is known as **The Dawned Priest**, while the other is known as **The Dawned Soldier**.

Both are the dawned child of man, and both are survivors during the absence of dawn. Their fate is to be crushed under the weight of violence since their birth, only to overcome it, like the dawn that rises after the darkest night.

The harsh past doesn't define them, but it is what grows the desire to crush even the embodiment of malice itself. Known to spite evil and very brutal in its eradications, they are greatly feared by demons and ghosts alike.

</Accordion>

<Accordion client:load title="Why is it placed in Good Fantasy faction?">

It is a bright concept if such a figure exists, that all conflicts in the world stopped in an instant, all vile acts stopped before it even happened.

But, that is not the case for this reality. So its placed in fantasy, a good one.
