| Vulcan Imperator | Rampant mass resource scavenging and unnatural environment harm rupture a sign, the giant volcano served as the resting place of the local god, bursts and births a form of a wrathful figure.

An old abandoned castle standing on the ageless horizon, structured in the plain of foggy and blurry ancient reminiscence. By its presence alone, you can almost grasp a powerful dusted imagery of a once-proud impenetrable standing monarchy.

| Unit | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Goblins | Sub-terranean creatures, they usually dwells in a cave, always bringing a horde alongside them to battle. Even though they're many, they are still weak, but you do have to fight more than **1**. |

| Soulforged Sovereign | "They said a true king does not walk; they're moved, carried by his majesty", This sentence resembles the last of an elder, withering Titan Lord, to finalize honing his craft upon true soul magic, a powerful, royal willpower. This last king of an ancient kingdom is truly destined as the final ruler of the now ruins of the past era, he haunts the kingdom to protect the remains of his subjects. |
| Ancestral Conquerer | A great flow of primal energy and winds flush through the air, a sense of primary fear and terror looms like a prey. **It**, is no mere man, nor a mindless beast, but rather, a figure of an elderly divine entity, an ancient being formed from beyond natural perception. It is the original cause of the immense ruination that plagues this great kingdom, *the great divide and demise*. |

Intimidating, he pushes armies with vigor, making them step back and hold their weapon firmly. <br><br>He's capable of summoning 3 Great Waraxe from the ground, which goes in **3** separate directions, giving Area denial and destroying ambush! |
| Umbrellina | A nimble, cold, and frigid duelist who excels in agility. She is whispered in antiquity to have been one of the unsuccessful royal princesses contending for the throne among her many sisters. Her ambition was to reign as queen, but she encountered nothing but abandonment in the wake of the collapse of **Vonaheim**. Yet, under the guidance of a specific *Lich* king after the fall of the fortress, she was turned into one of his disciples and transformed into a perilous assassin, carrying out its undisclosed decrees. The history holds no trace of her saber's lineage, yet its craftsmanship suggests connections to an old **Winterland** figure. |
| Forstenad | It is wide-known that all *Valkyrie* are females, well, atleast outside of *Far North*. This male *Valkyrie* is one of the old veteran of **Valheim** soldiers, with absolutely different fighting style than the faster *Valkyrie*, they stands near on the ground.

She was bestowed a mythical weapon named **Moonsaber**, which granted its wielder temporary control of time manipulation, able to blink to foes with near light-speed fast. <br><br>Due to her being a frost species, **Ice Wraith**, an ice organism, she's one of few who could handle such freezing weaponry, fully utilizing its potential. Rumors among the elders weave tales that she, perchance, holds the key to the genesis of her formidable blade, a weapon of unrivaled might and antiquity, which should've only exist in mythos. |
| Glacier Giant | In the land of *Far North*, where the edges of the world dissolve into the infinite expanse, lay a frozen ocean shrouded in the icy embrace of eternity. Snow-capped peaks and crystalline structures dominated the vast horizon, enveloping what seemed like half of the known world, if not more. The fabled **Mt. Yavhlix**, whispered of in hushed tones, bore witness to this chilling dominion, a monument to the frozen majesty that reigned supreme. <br><br>Legends spoke of its era preceding warmth, when the **Ice Age** ensnared the very heart of the earth. Among the shadows that prowled in that primordial darkness, there lay dormant a creature of immense magnitude. Described as a colossus of the mountains or even as the deity of the peaks, it possessed a weight that could shift the very foundations of the earth with each ponderous step. Its wrath was as formidable as the unleashed fury of a thawing avalanche, casting devastation upon the land. To liken this behemoth to the scale of mere mortals would be folly, for its true proportions rivaled even the grandeur of the mightiest summits, rendering human comparisons mere whispers against its colossal stature. |
